I was pleasantly surprised - the food was delicious. But the dining experience was terrible. They seemed understaffed for a Friday night - one waitress and one cook for a full restaurant. It took us around an hour to get our food, and when we did, our waitress had forgotten half of it. She apologized profusely and made it sound like she normally didn't wait tables, but it was frustrating. Our portions were also -very- small (which was strange, every other table seemed to have enormous heaping plates...maybe we ordered wrong!) and I left hungry. 

I'd like to give it another chance, because the food was very good, but I'm really hesitant.","review","fb9eLHJ4S--TyXsarJJo-g","Ethiopian",111,3.75675675675676,0,0,0,0,"AZ",3.5213447171825,2,4,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0.7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.64414414414414,3.5213447171825,13401,0,-1.5213447171825,0,0,0,0

As I knew nothing about Thai, she ordered a Thai Iced Tea for me, and it was creamy and delicious. Kinda like a Yoo-Hoo and iced tea, minus the chocolate. I ordered a second one, even though it was extra. I didn't care. 


We ordered the special appetizer, Soft Shell Crab. So worth the splurge. It was perfectly cleaned, unlike what I've had from Wholey's before. There were two sauces accompanying the crab, and both suited it's crispness perfectly. 

Jess made a few suggestions on what to get for the entree, (our waitress was in training, but still was awesome) and I decided on the Param, because I love peanut sauce! You could customize how hot you wanted your dish, but I was being a sissy that night, and decided to go with a 3. It was perfect. Jess got Yellow Curry Shrimp. I ate half of hers, too.  Oops. I've also never had curry before. Oh my. So good. 

We sat and chatted for a while, and were kept care of well with refills on our water. They are a BYOB,  so next time, I'll bring some beer!

All of us are very white and very non-Korean so I was concerned about the service we would receive after reading a few reviews on Yelp.  I was actually pleasantly surprised with the service.  Our waiter was very friendly and fast and answered any questions with a smile.

It was about 7pm on a Wednesday night and the place wasn't too crowded.  There were probably 15 other people in the place who were all of Asian decent so you know the place is the real deal.  The ambiance is a bit cafeteria-like but it didn't matter because I was there for a new culinary experience as this was my first time eating Korean food.

Now about the food....

After they take your drink and food orders, your table is given 6 or 7 small appetizers.  I don't remember what everything was but I do remember the kimchi.  I've never had it before but I know it is a Korean dining staple so I gave it a shot.  I was not a fan of it and probably won't ever have it again, but it was interesting to say the least.

Here is what we ordered:

* Mushroom Soon Tofu soup with beef - the soup is what this place seems to be known for judging by the Yelp reviews so I had to order it.  The bowl came out boiling hot which was good because we opted for the raw egg to be cracked and put into it right before it was served.  The soft tofu was a bit different to me but the soup had good flavor and a nice kick.  I would order it again but I'd like to try other ingredients such as prawns, etc.

* Short ribs - this is secretly why I wanted to come here.  I was told they were awesome and they were.  The marinate\sauce was not overpowering and they were very tender.  I will for sure order these again.

* BBQ chicken - not the leanest or best cut of chicken but it was very good and flavorful.  Again, the sauce\marinade was not too strong.

* Octopus in spicy sauce - this was the ""crazy"" dish for me for the evening.  I enjoy fried calamari and squid/octopus salad, but larger chunks of squid or octopus scare me a little.  I mean they weren't real big chunks but big enough to where you see you are eating a bunch of those little suction cup thingys that octopi have.  Between that and the chewiness of each bite made my stomach turn a bit.  However, the dish had good flavor and a nice kick thanks to the red sauce they bathed it in.  I'm not sure I would order this again.

Anyway, I would definitely come back again.  I enjoyed the service and would like to try other tofu soups and some of the other meat dishes.  I really want to try the bbq ribeye and bbq pork dishes in addition to more of that chicken and those short ribs!","review","PX3e3qtBx_5VC3vqq47jpQ","Korean",355,3.76338028169014,0,9,1,0,"AZ",4,2,3.5,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0.7,1,1,25,1,1,1,1,0,1.77777777777778,3.44444444444444,2,3.5,1.64414414414414,3.5213447171825,14616,0.0704225352112676,0,0,2,3,5

And aren't Phoenicians lucky to be able to compare two great Ethiopian food restaurants? Heck, I'd never had Ethiopian before coming to AZ, so I consider us lucky to have such great places to eat. Getting off track...I prefer the Blue Nile Cafe for three reasons: Kay Seer Salad (beet salad), Shuro Watt (ground chickpeas with spices) and the House Iced Tea. 

The Kay Seer Salad is perfect - I have tried to recreate it, but can never get the perfect blend of beet, spice, and citrus tang. Even if you're not the biggest fan of beets, you can't help but enjoy this light salad. PS: It's vegan. Half of their menu is vegan.

The Shuro Watt is perhaps the most delightfully blended mix of chickpeas, spices and happiness. It looks like mush, but you can never trust the appearance of the food to describe how it will taste. Just stick your nose over it and you'll be convinced. (Is that a hint of cinnamon? Maybe nutmeg? It's heaven, whatever it is.) I always, ALWAYS get the Shuro Watt when I eat here. ALWAYS.

And there is nothing that compliments a meal better than a perfect cup of tea. One of the waitresses told me the ""secret"" for their black tea, and again, I have tried to recreate it but not perfected what I drink at Blue Nile. The hints of clove and cardamom in the tea are not overwhelming, but just right.

I have eaten at Cafe Lalibella, and enjoyed it as well, but like I've stated, it doesn't compare (for me) to the Blue Nile cafe.","review","fb9eLHJ4S--TyXsarJJo-g","Ethiopian",72,4.15277777777778,0,2,0,0,"AZ",3,2,4,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0.7,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,3.5,0,0,1.64414414414414,3.5213447171825,14569,0,2,1,0,0,0

The broth is  rapidly boiling, chile laden and filled with chunks of silky tofu and beef dumplings.  They crack an egg into the little cauldron and you stir it up and enjoy.  It is also served with a bowl of rice.  The portion is good for 1 1/2 meals. All for around $8.  Every time, I request it spicy, and every time, it is not.

Well, now that I have, I have to say that ""Flavors Of India"" is the best Indian Food in Phoenix, bar none!

First off, when you walk into an ethnic food restaurant, and the place is filled with people of the same ethnicity, and the place is really quiet because everyone is busy enjoying their food, you know it's a good place to eat.  

Is it a bad thing when the host/manager recognizes you when you walk in... and remembers your order?  You'd think we eat there a lot or something.  I've found my favorite dish is the Chicken Tikka Masala, medium spicy and if you like shrimp, the Shrimp Tikka Masala is just as yummy!  We usually order a side of the Paneer Kulcha (unleavened bread stuffed with Indian style cheese), which is wonderful to sop up the extra yummy sauce after you are finished.  Portion sizes don't appear to be too large, but we always have leftovers.  And it's always better the second day too!

In the often plastic (some might say ""soulless"") city of Phoenix, it is to the city's myriad ethnic restaurants where one must travel to find real personality and character. Greektown does not disappoint. To use crude language, the owner is one ""cocky son of a gun."" But, I still loved him! His enthusiasm for his food is contagious. It's hard to describe in words, but let's just say that he eats his Wheaties in the morning! All inquiries about menu items are answered in a detailed fashion with a hearty side of wit. You really have to come to the restaurant to see what I mean.

The food was good, but I don't think spectacular. As other reviewers have said, the restaurant is a good value. Your meal includes soup, salad and plenty of delicious pita/garlic bread. I ordered a chicken entree that included artichoke hearts and was satisfied, but not wowed. Perhaps it's me or perhaps it's the restaurant? I can't really say given that I've never had Greek food before. I will share, however, that one of my dining partners found the sauce used to make his ""Greek lasagna"" similar in taste and consistency to that found in Chef Boyardee canned pastas; sort of sweet and slimy. Desserts were a definite treat. Most of my tablemates pronounced my cheesecake the best of the bunch (even better than the super-sweet Bakalava).

Come for the crazy owner (HINT: You must love singing and attentive service), but stay for the cheesecake. If the ""good, but not great"" entrees leave you less than impressed, the overall experience will still make the time and money expended worth it.","review","lxfalv_k7V8X-ESUS34HuA","Greek",44,2.90909090909091,0,0,0,0,"AZ",3.5213447171825,2,4.5,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0.7,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.64414414414414,3.5213447171825,14159,0,0.478655282817503,1,2,4.5,3

It did take a little while (even with us and only one other party seated), but I was told this is because all items are cooked fresh when you order.  The lady serving us was very friendly, even when my friend was giving me crap about ordering medium spicy and not hot .  

It was all very good (If I attempted to spell some of the dishes I'd end up offending someone), I kept eating long after my stomach said ""no more"", since my taste buds were saying ""keep going!!""  

I will definitely be returning very soon!","review","XguGFMUSEMz4wx_2G-otyA","Thai",90,3.77777777777778,0,4,0,0,"AZ",3.5,1,4,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0.7,1,1,7,0,1,1,0,0,0,2.875,0,0,1.64414414414414,3.5213447171825,13970,0.0777777777777778,1.5,1,0,0,0

My Aunt is from Dallas, and works with some Ethiopians and said that the food was great.  Had a ton of flavor and was something different.  I was completely out of my comfort zone, but I said ""what the hell?"" and went along for the ride.

I certainly am glad that I did. I have been back several times.  We had one of the traditional combination meals to be shared by the three of us.  It was great.  

For those like myself who have never eaten Ethiopian food before, here is a little run down of what goes on.  First, you order as a group and their serve your platter family style.  They give you some injera, which is like a pita or tortilla that you use to then pinch your food as you eat bite by bite.  The injera is somewhat gummy, and has an unusual texture which definitely takes getting used to.  If you visualize grabbing some hummus with a piece of pita bread, that is what you are doing when eating your food.  It's more of a pinch than a scoop, but I think you catch my drift.  The different food that they place on the platter is called Wat.  My favorite was the doro wat.  The coffee was excellent as well at Lalibela.

The restaurant itself is nothing too spectacular, but it didn't bother me.  It was extremely clean, and you could tell that care was put into everything about the restaurant.  The staff was very helpful, and showed pride for their product and their country.  I look forward to coming back again.","review","-bd26a1QEEpqUZjBmtBUiQ","Ethiopian",19,4.15789473684211,0,0,0,0,"AZ",3.5213447171825,2,4,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0.7,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.64414414414414,3.5213447171825,14580,0,0.478655282817503,1,0,0,0

But Pho Real seemed like a safe bet for tasting Vietnamese food based on the recommendations of co-workers.  I've been twice in the past 3 weeks and I'm equally impressed with the service and food.

On both occasions, I ordered the delicious lemongrass chicken.  It's a sweet and spicy dish with grilled chicken, onions (and lots of 'em), zucchini, carrots, and cauliflower.  This heaping dish is served with clumpy white rice.  The flavor is out of this world!  On the first trip, I ordered a Jasmine tea and on my last trip, a mango-flavored bubble tea.  The bubble tea is more like a smoothie/slushie with tapioca balls at the bottom...yum yum!  I felt like a kid again.  

On both trips, I was promptly seated.  The server was proactive in asking if I had any questions about the dishes and regularly checked on me.  My parents, who had not eaten Vietnamese food previously, joined me for the second visit.  I explained to Hannah, the owner, and she was very gracious in explaining the menu options.  After they decided on pho, she brought out the ""fixings"" (lime, mint leaves, bean sprouts) and suggested how they should enjoy an authentic pho.  No condescension or impatience on Hannah's part, I'm really impressed by that.

It looks like people buy kimchi and other ban chan in bulk to go here too. I might go back and try other dishes before I completely write it off, but I wasn't impressed.

Ordered:
-Combo plate w fried rice
-Mool naeng myun (cold noodle)
-Chili japchae

The combo plate was the best bang for buck. The galbi, meat jun, fried rice were all good.. not amazing. Mool naeng myun was terrible. I usually don't order it unless I'm really in the mood, because I haven't found many places outside of Korea that can make this well. Unfortunately, I happened to be in the mood for it. Sometimes I can tolerate it by adding vinegar and mustard to cover most of the taste. This one didn't taste like much of anything even after adding the mustard and vinegar. Probably one of the worst / bottom five.

We ordered chili japchae which we thought was regular japchae with peppers to add a kick. Instead, it was stir fried onions and peppers, which confused us. It tasted like a thai dish I've had and was pretty good, but not what we expected at all.

The kimchi was good, so I wouldn't mind buying this to-go.","review","xxOQ7h6s3InV8o8DOVHlMA","Korean",5,2.8,0,1,0,0,"NV",2,2,4.5,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1.3,0,1,2,0,1,1,0,0,2,4,0,0,1.64414414414414,3.5213447171825,16030,0.4,1,1,0,0,0

This is the first and only Japanese pastry place. If you're a fan of Kabuto or Goyemons treats, these are the pastry chefs that created those items. For those who have never had Japanese desserts the best way to describe them is decadent, yet delicate. It's not about saccharine, sugary highs, but all about balance. Often they play on flavors that are a bit sweet, a bit savory (think green tea, red bean, sesame, etc). 

I picked up some stuff to-go : 

Green tea cream puff - solid cream puff. I sliced it in half and half of the cream is vanilla cream and half was nice, strong matcha flavored whip. We make some awesome cream puffs at home and I feel these are just as good. 

Brandied cherry black forest - I enjoyed the chocolate mousse in this and appreciated that the cherries were brandied and not the usual neon ice cream cherries. 

Yuzu panna cotta - This was bright citrusy pungent flavor that I love about yuzu and the texture was on point of a panna cotta. I get rather disappointed how unbalanced many places are between creamy and gelatine. 

Tofu cheesecake - light and fluffy. I'm a big fan of Japanese style cheesecake since it's almost like a whipped mousse instead of being dense. It's one of those things that you can eat a lot of since it's not overbearing.

For the quality, the prices aren't out of line, but this isn't your cheapest bakery either. The quality though and presentation is top notch and something you would expect to see at a on strip patisserie charging for more. If you were going to a dinner party or gifting pastries, this would be one of the places to consider for being beautiful, and having unique offerings.

Went to this place as a suggestion from my friend,jon, who loves this place.

Went on a Friday night and it was pretty empty. There was about 5 parties there ranging from 1 to 6 people pet table.

The staff seemed pretty bored, which added to the boring ambience. There's nothing that makes it scream, ""Indian restaurant"". 

Our wait staff was pretty good, always there when we needed.

They gave us a little too much time to over view the menu.

I'll start off with the appetizers.

There's a complimentary plate of a baked type of chip? That's served with 2 different sauces. One was sweet and red like a thin chutney. The other was spicier and green like a salsa verde. Overall it reminded me of chips and salsa. 

We ordered meat Samosas to start. They're pretty much ground beef empanadas with Indian seasonings. Overall it was good, but definitely not a stand out I'd go back for. Very mild.

I ordered a tasting dinner.

This came with: basmati rice, naan, a goat curry, a chicken curry, and a shrimp curry. It was also served with a cool, cucumbery, white sauce and a sweet dessert cup.

The portions were good; enough to share.

Although it was all really good.. The food definitely tasted like it just came out of serving pots. The only one that seemed like the meat was stewed in the curry was the goat. The chicken and shrimp servings came off as if the chicken or shrimp was added into the sauce before being brought out. 

Also, the three different curries seemed to be of varying heat. The goat was most mild, then the chicken, and then the shrimp being the spiciest. 

I'd definitely recommend getting this ""meat dinner"" if you've never had Indian food. 

You get a little taste of everything.

The menu was definitely hard to understand. There's one goat,  one veggie, one seafood, and one chicken section each with about 6-8 different options to have your choice of entree in.

The descriptions really don't give any idea of what to expect from what you order. I.e. Chicken in spicy curry sauce VS. Chicken in very spicy curry sauce.

I hated the seating of this place. They should definitely get a new interior designer. The tables are so close with no booths! I felt like I was unintentionally eaves dropping everyone's conversations.

For food: I'd definitely give the food a 4.5 out of five. The only complaint would be my food wasnt served completely piping hot. One dish was warm while the others weren't ect. But taste was definitely awesome! All the curries were different like I ordered three different dishes and eating with naan or rice changed the tastes too.

Service: 4 out of 5. It was satisfactory and I have no complaints, but nothing spectacular.

Price: 3 out of 5. I'm a huge fan of Thai curry, but it just doesn't seem worth it for the price. My meal with one mango lassi(which was underwhelming) and Samosas($7) was about $45. It's about 2 cups of curry, rice, and naan for $21-24 dollars.

I've never eaten Japanese curry before, so I decided to try it for the first time at this highly-rated establishment. The photos of white rice and brown curry on plain white plates did not stimulate my appetite (slightly unappetizing looking), however, those 150 Yelpers before me could not all be wrong. For our late lunch, we shared a regular-size order of rice and curry (spice level 0) with the 5 piece Kushi Curry option. I'm not sure of the ""right"" way to eat curry, so I mixed together the rice and curry slurry and dug in. Mmm. Wow, it's really very yummy, a fantastic combination of spices. The skewers of fried goodies were all pretty good too. I really liked the potato croquette. It was something like mashed potatoes rolled in an egg mixture and coated with panko, then lovingly lowered it into the deep fryer. The panko-coated fried quail eggs were slightly rubbery and had a green-grey tinge around the yolk, but no biggie. Most people boil the heck out of eggs. 

Yelp did me right. Thank you!

*Filling, low-brow tasty Asian fare
*Nice service
*Tiny hole in the wall with a few bar stools and (three?) small tables, so try to come at off-peak meal times.

I never had Ethiopian food before so I had no idea what to expect. First of all, the service was wonderful. Kind and warm and lots of smiles. I love all the authentic decor inside. It is not fancy but it is homey and has some great authentic crafts and pictures to really get a good feel for the Ethiopian culture.

The food was so good. My husband had the fish, lamb, and collard greens. He loved it all but especially the fish. I had the cabbage and potatoes, red lentils, and collard greens. Loved it all as well. The lentils were medium spicy, just right. A little reminiscent of Indian food. The collard greens were mouth watering. Cooked perfectly.

The flatbread thing it came with was definitely unique. Spongy and a bit sour. Takes a little getting used to but its good! 

They recommend picking 3 of their ""mini"" entrees. Each one is a very generous scoop. We each had 3 and we were stuffed. Next time we are just ordering 2 each... it is very filling. 

I was disappointed that they only had one Ethiopian beer in stock... the menu said there were 3. I wanted a lighter Ethiopian beer to complement my meal but they only had a dark brew. The selection of other beers they have are limited but good. I settled for an ice cold Stella.

We have to try their tiramisu next time. It is supposed to be the best in the valley.","review","-bd26a1QEEpqUZjBmtBUiQ","Ethiopian",17,3.52941176470588,0,13,5,1,"AZ",3.92307692307692,2,4,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0.7,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1.76923076923077,3.34615384615385,2,3.5,1,4,16194,0,1.07692307692308,1,0,0,0

I had always wanted to try it, but I never had the opportunity. Before I begin, let me just say that not all Indian food has curry in it, contrary to popular belief. That's like saying all Japanese eat sushi or RAW sushi, and that's also not entirely true.   Anyway, they start you off with papadum, which is a seasoned crispy tortilla that they serve with chutney. If you've never had chutney, the best way I can describe it is to think of it as a spicy pesto, with a subtle hint of mint. For the appetizer, we had samosas (you can get it with chicken or vegetables, we opted for the vegetables), basically an Indian egg roll. The dipping sauce they serve it with reminded me of funnel cake. So delicious! My entree was the chicken tikka masala. They give you a choice of spice-level of one to fifteen.  I opted for an eight, only because I've never had Indian food before (as I mentioned) and I didn't want it too hot for my first time nor did I want it bland. An eight was just right. And I'm amazed how rich their food is. I will definitely be going back! 

Oh, if you're curious, my fiancé had bhindi masala, which was equally good. His dish had some curry in it, mine did not.  :) The people who work there are friendly, but don't expect to hold a conversation with most of them. They know enough English to ask for your order, if they can get you anything else, and that's about it. But they are very nice people. It's nice to go into a restaurant like this one and see other Indians eating AND working there. As I said, I will definitely go back! 

I forgot about the dessert!! They give you this dish that has something that looks like a donut hole that's in rice pudding. It wasn't too sweet - it was just right for what was for dinner. If you haven't tried this place yet, you're definitely missing out! And don't be afraid of the spices.

I wanted to try something new and I was in Chinatown area. I've never had Japanese style fried chicken with curry sauce. It looked interesting, so I decided to stop by.

I started out by ordering Ashi ($2.95/small glass). I ordered Toko-yaki (~$4) and fried shu-mai ($3.75). Toko-yaki was batter was good, but the octopus was bit too chewy. Fried shu-mai are really small, but they have good flavor and frying anything makes it great. 

My main course meal was the chicken katsu with level 10 spicy curry. This might be the first restaurant to charge money to make things spicy (like I won't be paying a price next morning). When I the plate the curry sauce looked red hot (not sure if you can see it in the pic), but upon eating it I was bit disappointed with the spice level. However, I became a fan of this meal. I think this is the best way to eat a fried chicken. The chicken was tender and the batter was just the right amount. Rice and curry also complimented very well with juicy chicken. The price is also perfect $9 for the whole meal. 

I will definitely be back for more. The only negatives I can say is that the TVs are tiny, and I wish the bathrooms didn't smell like someone had a curry explosion. The service is good and the servers take their time to explain the menu item if you are new.

I had never had Ethiopian food, but when my wife told me that Ethiopian restaurants offer raw meat, my interest was definitely piqued. 
The place is small and we were the only ones there.
The woman that served us was also an owner, and she was one of the nicest, most patient, and knowledgeable server that I've ever had.
She explained all the dishes to us, but I was only interested in trying the raw beef.
The bread was not my favorite thing, but I can honestly say that it was nothing like I've ever tasted before. Spongy, sour, and I learned that it is not cooked, just poured onto a flat surface and left to set.
The raw meat was reminiscent of steak tar-tar, except that it was a huge portion.
I would have preferred it a little less seasoned, but the server told me that the next time I go there, I should order a different raw dish that would better suit my taste. 
My wife ordered some vegetarian plate, so I didn't taste any of her dish, but for what it's worth, it looked good. 
They also owned a little shop next door, and our server walked us there and introduced us to one of her relatives who was behind the counter. This server was so nice.

All of the food was very good and my first time eating Greek food, will definitely go back for the food. The Baklava and Canollies were great also.

The downside was the service, or lack of. The tables were all a mess and customers were having to clear their own tables before they could sit down. Everyone was stacking the dirty dishes on a single table and it got stacked so high stuff was falling off the table. The young kid who was working the register and walking around didn't seem to care at all that people didn't have a place to sit and when people were at the register to order he would ignore them and just keep walking around not really doing anything. We had to get up and leave sooner than we wanted because there were people waiting for our table because the others had so much dirty dishes on them and ours only had the two plates.

I ordered and then three other customers came in and ordered after me. They all got their food before me and I had to go up to the counter and ask why my wife and I had not been served yet. He looked in the back and seen our food sitting there and grabbed it and walked it to our table and never said a word.","review","CckmnbRINaLB4Aaq1dAFCQ","Greek",129,3.4031007751938,0,13,5,9,"AZ",3.61538461538462,1,4,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0.7,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1.38461538461538,3.61538461538462,2,4.3,1.44444444444444,3.94444444444444,15563,0,-0.615384615384615,0,1,4.5,5

The food was pretty good though!  We ordered the Pork, Chicken, Sausage, and Potato cake and all were juicy and flavorful.

The only colors were brown sauce with white rice with a few ""lumps"" under the sauce.  No Color whatsoever, but I thought it might  be an advertising mistake that the owner just had to deal with.

Walking into this restaurant, I really liked how they decorated this place. The dark woods, and mellow atmosphere really gave it a sexy vibe. I was digging it.

Gyu-Kaku might have the best grills I have ever seen. What makes them so great are the little vents that surrounds the grill. This makes the smoke disappear quickly, rather than engulf your clothes in meat smoke, which tends to happen at k-bbqs.

The first thing I ordered were the cheese wontons. Out of everything that I had ordered, this proved to be my least favorite. When I was thinking of a cheese wonton, I expected there to be a full pocket of cheese. That was not to be the case. Instead, there was the tiniest sliver of cheese that could be known to mankind. I should have taken a picture of that.

Then my meats came. I thought they were alright. I thought it was good, but I guess I was expecting more. Even though I came in during happy hour, I ordered like three dishes and spent quite a bit on them. Afterwards, I had to go buy a cheeseburger at a take out joint nearby because I was still pretty hungry.

The service here was not very good. The guy taking our order was very nice and accommodating, but he seemed lost at times. I constantly had to flag him down. And, he did mess up our order at the end of the night, charging us for extra things that we didn't order, but we were quickly able to fix the situation.

I don't know if I'll be back here. My experience was so-so. Maybe I'll come back here later in the future if they improve their service. But I thought the food was aight except for the cheese wontons, which were a ripoff. That's my story, and I'm sticking to it.","review","5mMk3Ted-EOyHvJ-j9BhiQ","Japanese",38,4.07894736842105,0,43,24,15,"NV",3.81395348837209,2,4,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1.3,0,1,21,1,1,1,1,1,1.6046511627907,3.91860465116279,1.70833333333333,3.97916666666667,1.93333333333333,4.06666666666667,16382,0.552631578947368,-0.813953488372093,0,2,4.5,4

I really enjoyed the food and will definitely add it the list of my favorites. However, I do disagree with the way they take sit-down orders (explained below). 

The inside of the restaurant isn't that big and since it looked more like a bistro type of place with a big menu on the wall above the register, we walked up to the register to place our orders. When it was our time, finally, she told us if we wanted to dine in, we can go and sit down, so we did. The problem was though, that they only had one person for everything: answering the phone, taking the to-go orders and serving. So it took another 10 minutes until she came up to us, because she took a ton of other to-go orders, until she finally came to take ours. I think it would be easier if they would let you order your food at the register, pay for it, and then go sit down, or at least have a separate server.  

Anyway, we ordered the Hawaiian style tuna poke and the combination plate with 3 choices of meat. We got the spicy chicken, chicken katsu, and the bulgogi. They all came with a good portion of rice and some small portions of assorted vegetables and salads. 

The ahi tuna was very fresh, but the portion was almost bite size for $7. The 3 choices of meats we had, were all very fresh and good spiced. I really enjoyed all of them. 

Yesterday, I also found out that they have another location in North Las Vegas, closer to where we live.

I've never had Vietnamese cuisine before, so with some help from my server, I ordered the large beef combination pho and some spring rolls to start.

The awful part was that the table was really sticky and there were soup spoons in a holder which I had to pick through 3 of them to find a clean one to use.

It was a quiet Tuesday night and primarily we were the only people there until we were leaving and a couple smaller parties started coming in. 

The restaurant has cool woodwork throughout, and a few long more private rooms where they can do tabletop BBQ.  As soon as I entered, the pungent smell of Kim Chee filed my nostrils and took me back to my childhood to my best friend's house. Her Korean parents emigrated and keep the Korean culinary traditions alive. Perhaps she was embarrassed of it and always wanted to come over to our house but I had actually never had Korean BBQ until Cho Won.

First they brought out accompaniments such as Kim Chee, steamed egg, bean sprouts, radishes, dried herring, etc. In small bowls for us to sample. Most of them were quite good and were definitely authentic.
my friend Chesley B. Doesn't like much except chicken and the only thi he could get on the menu was Chicken Yakitori, which as you know, is actually Japanese. He ordered the large version of the ""app"" and it was massive! It had enough for 2! It was very good (4/5). I debated whether or not to get the prime rib or the short ribs but I took our friendly waitress' suggestion and ordered the short ribs for $26. Not cheap right? Well they came out and were succulent, sweet, tender, perfectly seasoned and absolutely scrumptious. I'm not a huge red meat eater but I ate every damn morsel on that plate (save the piece I gave to Ches and Brant). (5/5!!!) I also made the group try soju after trying it when I was in Japan.

If you're driving south on South Blvd, you have to make a u turn at the apartment complex right south of the restaurant and then you will be there. I wasn't sure what to go get but I heard from many that their Pho is great but after a weak lunch, I needed something with more substance and went with the Grilled Beef Bun  I absolutely loved it!! It was so light and flavorful along with all the sauces they provided table side. When it came out, the smell somewhat reminded me of pad thai because of the peanuts. I had the intention of eating half then take the rest home but was starving that I cleaned the plate--the portion was huge and worth every bite! 

I felt like we ordered and BAM the food was out in an instant so that is a huge plus in my world. Kind and attentive staff  with instrumental music (I noticed ""Unbreak My Heart"" and ""Easy Like Sunday Morning"") that was soothing and enjoyable. One of the tables near us had the make your own spring roll sampler and that looked fun with a huge platter of goodies and would love to try that next time because there will DEFINITELY  be a next time with this place (with beer in hand)","review","nPjEhnjfqbno8J2qgTjfPQ","Vietnamese",196,3.73979591836735,0,9,0,0,"NC",3.88888888888889,2,4,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1.1,1,1,14,1,1,1,0,0,1.88888888888889,3.55555555555556,0,0,1.64414414414414,3.5213447171825,14915,0.0714285714285714,0.111111111111111,1,2,4,5

Seated in a beautiful glassed in room over looking the street, the service was wonderful, and the food even better.  There is a delicious Roasted Red Pepper soup that is FABULOUS.  It is not on the menu every day, and my date had gone the night before to ask if they could make it for us, and they did!  (You can see why both the date and restaurant impressed me, :D )

Since I have never had Indian food (that i recall) I let my date take the lead and order for us, and he did wonderful!  He ordered Chicken Tikka Masala, which is chicken breast in a creamy curry (maybe tomato/coconut as well) sauce, served over rice.  If i could have licked my plate and still looked like a lady i so would have done it!  lol  He also ordered lamb over rice which was also very tasty.  

For desert you MUST try the Kulfi.  The best way to describe Kulfi is to say it is similar to an Ice Cream type desert, but more dense.  It has a wonderful, yet different flavor, due to the addition of cardamom.  Copper offers several flavors, and we tried quit a few of them, and ALL of them were delicious.

Defiantly a 5 star experience all around, atmosphere (very romantic), wait staff did a wonderful job, food was fantastic, and their presentation is BEAUTIFUL (makes you almost a little sad to dig in and mess it up)!!  Can't wait to go back!

I've only been to Indian restaurants a handful of times and each of those times was with ""experienced"" Indian restaurant-goers, so I was a little intimidated to be in charge of ordering (my bf has never had Indian food before). To be safe, I ordered the ""classics"": Lamb masala, palak paneer (spinach and tofu), and daal makhni (lentils)... they were all delicious! The masala was probably our favorite. The rice and naan (we got the garlic) were both great with our saucy dishes. Bf had the Himalayan beer (nice a light) and I had the strawberry lassi. I love the sweet, yogurty tartness of it with the flavorful spiciness of the dishes. 

My boyfriend also tried the ""Red Chili Pickles"" that were advertised at the table. His order was met with raised eyebrows and an ""are you sure?"" by our server. What we got were not even remotely close to what we know to be pickles... my best guess is maybe some type of bean curd wrapped in chili skin. It was more salty than spicy (hence the pickle name?). We asked our server what it was and he said he had no idea and had never had it before. Ha! They seemed very impressed that my bf ate the ""pickles"".

When we just walked in, we weren't greeted by anybody. There was a very strong aroma of some sort of incense that clouded the room. It was pretty overpowering.  We saw some lady sitting in the corner of the room staring at us. We assumed she was a customer since she didn't say anything, but eventually she got up and we asked her if we could sit anywhere, she said yes. We sat down and she brought us one menu for the both of us, which was a little awkward trying to read from two different sides of the table.

 There were a lot of plates on the menu, but since we never had Ethiopian before we didn't know what to get. We opted for the #16, which was the sauteed beef strips for $10.99. We decided to share since we weren't sure about their portions. Good thing we did that, cuz their plate was humungo. 

 For our drinks we ordered coke ($1.50) and tea ($1.50). I was kind of expecting the tea to be something different, but when she brought it to me she just gave me a glass with hot water and a Lipton tea bag on the side.  My boyfriend just got a can of coke with a straw. 

Our food came and it looked like fajitas and salad on top of a giant crepe. She also gave us a basket of more crepe looking things (sorry I never found out the name). He ate a little piece of it on it's own and he didn't like it, it had a salty vinegar taste to it. Surprisingly it actually tasted pretty good when wrapped around a piece of meat and salad. 

I enjoyed being able to eat with my hands and not be stared at, but I think it would be nice if they provided some sort of wet towelette to wipe our hands with. 

All in all this was a pretty good experience for us. Ethiopian isn't my favorite type of food, but I'm happy I can say that I tried it. I've actually had a few people tell me that this is one of the most authentic Ethiopian places in Vegas.

I consider myself pretty adventurous when it comes to food and I'll try just about anything once, so it surprised me when I realized that I had never had Vietnamese cuisine before.
 
Upon reviewing the menu, I was very thankful that they include descriptions of the dishes under each entrée. I settled on the Bun Cha Thit Nuong  which was described as having charbroiled pork with bean sprouts, lettuce, herb, cucumber & peanuts on vermicelli with a crispy spring roll.  Grilled Pork and veggies; how could you go wrong?  About five minutes later I had my ""Bun Cha"" in front of me.  Here's where I discovered my ignorance.... I swirled my chop stick around the noodles ensuring to include a nice piece of pork  and when I tasted it I found, to my surprise, that it was cold.  Very tasty mind you but cold.  I'm at least proud of the fact that instead of immediately calling the nice lady who waited on me over, I had the good sense to Google what it was that I was eating.
 
It turns out that Wikipedia described my dish exactly how it was served to me: ""Bún tht nng (literally means ""rice noodles [with] grilled meat"") is a popular Vietnamese cold rice vermicelli noodle dish topped with grilled pork, fresh herbs like basil and mint, fresh salad and bean sprouts, and ch giò (spring rolls)."" Yes, the good folks at Vietnam's Pho do indeed serve up authentic dishes. Although it wasn't what I expected at first, I did find the meal very enjoyable and I look forward to coming back and trying other Vietnamese cuisine here.","review","2EEmhVhG5SCt8dEo5zf-Hg","Vietnamese",6,4,0,10,0,12,"PA",3.6,1,3.5,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,2,0,1,1,0,1,1.9,3.55,0,0,1.83333333333333,3.54166666666667,16597,0.333333333333333,0.4,1,0,0,0

This visit was a visit of firsts. My first time at this restaurant and my first time eating Vietnamese food. Both were spectacular! This restaurant isn't much to look at on the outside, but it's got everything it needs on the inside including friendly staff, cheap prices and delicious dishes. 

I will admit that the menu is completely overwhelming for a newbie like me. I had no idea what I wanted, but luckily I was dining with pros so they guided me in the right direction. I started with the spring rolls and opted for a pork bun. The spring rolls were really refreshing and I enjoyed the peanut sauce to accompany it. I wasn't a huge fan of the basil and/or cilantro that came inside, so next time I would ask for them to leave the herbs out. The bun was delicious and huge! I snuck some of my remaining peanut sauce in there and poured in the sauce that came with it. I had no idea that it was fish sauce but I'm glad I didn't because I gave it a chance and really liked it! The bun had pork, noodles and eggs rolls. I only ate about half of it and was completely stuffed but not in a bad way. It was the perfect amount of food with the right spices and heartiness. As I enjoyed my meal and company, I looked around and noticed how crowded this place gets with every walk of life!

Guess how much my bill was for spring rolls, bun and a diet coke? Around $8-$10. I'm serious!

We were tired and hungry and sitting in the hallway to the parking lot of Paris.  We turned around and saw a poster for SEA directly above our heads.  Something in my mind clicked and I realized that this was the sister restaurant for SEA in New York which was featured in Sex & the City but also, more importantly, for one of my favorite scenes in one of my favorite movies of all time: Garden State.  ""umm...we're a Vietnamese restaurant?  We don't serve bread?""  ""Can I get something to chew on?  F***, bamboo.  Whatever.""

So it was decided that we would go to SEA for our final meal that weekend in Vegas.

I'd never had Vietnamese food before, so I stuck to my old standby, shrimp red curry and sticky rice, from the Thai said of the restaurant.  The shrimp was well cooked and the curry flavorful.  BF went for a Vietnamese noodle dish with steak.  Mine was very very good, however, the Vietnamese dish was outstanding.  I totally wished I'd gotten the same thing.  The noodles were delicate and the steak supremely flavorful and tender.

The atmosphere is great--I absolutely love sitting along the water, facing the statue.  I thought I would just explode quoting Garden State throughout dinner.  My one issue was that the lighting was dim and pleasant, but that there was no curtain separating the glaring kitchen lights from the rest of the eating area, some what taking away the dream light atmosphere.

Best of all, it didn't totally break the bank and was a truly delicious and memorable meal.

I must say i was impressed.  We had all 3 of the appetizers, Timatim Firfir, which is a mix of tomatoes, onions, jalapenos, olive oil and lemon juice, and injera diced up and all mixed together....you can also request this without the injera in it, which i liked better!

We had the avocado salad, which comes looking like a giant injera burrito.  It was excellent, and triangle pastries filled with a spice beef mixture and a side of spice green stuff to dip it in.  It was a little more spice than i can handle, but i will admit, i am a spice WEENIE!  However all the food is made to order, so they were very willing to make things more or less spicy for us, upon request, which is SUPER helpful.

For the entree we had the Queen Sheeba Special, which was cubed bits of beef in a very nice, tasty sauce, with jalapenos (which were not overly spicy) tomatoes and onions.  You have the choice of having it with injera or rice and we opted for rice since we had plenty of injera with our salad burrito looking things.

We ended our meal with ethiopian coffee, which reminded both of us of the flavor of trukish coffee, which we find to be very good.

This place is not only a restaurant but also a bar.  We were here on a sunday afternoon, but you could tell they had a dance floor and a stage for bands, and a big screen to play videos on.  i'm sure this place is a jammin' when it's party night.

This area has been changing for years and its development is, for me, one of the things that make Charlotte a more interesting place to be. Queen Sheba is one of these eateries, recommended by a friend. My daughter and ""go to"" restaurant companion drove out of our way to try what we knew was going to be something different. I used to do business in the Middle East and Northern Africa so past experience with this region's cuisine gave me some idea of what to expect - some kind of flat bread, no utensils, lots of fragrant spice though not too much heat - but I had never eaten Ethiopian food so we were excited. 

We got there way early around 5:30 and the place was empty except for a few obvious regulars collecting empty Corona bottles at the bar. I know in Egypt dinner doesn't even begin until well after 10:00 pm so I expect the place livens up later. The décor is pretty plain and simple, with a large screen TV playing whatever soccer game is on, plastic covers on the tables and low lighting. Our server however could not have been more gracious and welcoming and allowed us to pick a booth that suited us.

Injera, as far as I can tell, is some sort of sour dough pancake, very spongy and in this case it was served cold with all of our dishes. As I said, there are no utensils so this flat bread is an important aid to scooping up the various stewed puréed and chopped dishes put before you. The taste of the Injera is slightly sour and provides a terrific counterpoint to the spicy dishes with which it is served. We started with an avocado salad which turned out to be a delicious chunky guacamole in an Injera burrito. The ingredients were fresh and the serving large. Two of us shared it as a really good appetizer. The beef combination was served on a large circle of Injera on an aluminum platter about 2 feet across and consisted of raw chopped beef, sautéed  beef tips, collard greens, green beans, a pumpkin purée, mashed yams and feta cheese crumbles. It was plenty for two but my companion wanted to try the lamb so she ordered Ye-Beg Tibs which were small bits of lamb sautéed with onions and mild peppers along with a small green salad and served on a large round of Injera. 

Everything we were served was very good. This was especially true of the avocado salad and the vegetables. Flavors of the main ingredient were allowed to take a front seat and while I am sure that it was pumpkin or winter squash that I was eating and some sort of yam, the flavors were completely new to me. The collard greens served as a clear reminder of the African roots of some Southern US staples.

We would definitely go back. The combination platters are quite enough for two, especially if you split an appetizer and want to leave room for dessert which we did not try. Prices are very reasonable and the family setting is very welcoming.","review","sOsRiemCb1f_FdwjOVHl9w","Ethiopian",3,3.66666666666667,0,0,0,0,"NC",3.5213447171825,2,3.5,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1.1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.64414414414414,3.5213447171825,15991,0,0.478655282817503,1,0,0,0

We decided on the Meat Lovers but substituted spicy garlic edamame for the seaweed salad that was standard. Our sides arrived quickly.  I noticed that we were the minority and the clientele was primarily Asian so I took that as a good sign.  

Having never had Korean BBQ before it would have been nice to get some instruction on what to do with everything. As an example, we cooked our meat on the sides instead of in the middle and it kept sticking to the grill. When there was just a little meat left on one plate, the server placed it on the grill for us and that's when we realized our placement error. 
Another thing that might be helpful is some type of labeling on all of the different items so we would know what we were eating.  
Everything we had was delicious.  I think the standout for me with regards to main dishes was the marinated pork.  All the appetizers were amazing.  The miso soup was so rich and flavorful.  The dressing on the salad was delicious and just the right amount of sweet.  The chili dumplings had a really tasty sauce and I thoroughly enjoyed the spicy garlic edamame.  
We discovered why they have so many reviews, too! Free dessert for posting a review.
Overall, I really enjoyed my experience and would like to try it again, maybe someplace else to see if the experience is the same.","review","iUPJmJvHy9fVfRxsuwwdLQ","Korean",1,4,0,1,0,1,"NV",5,2,4.5,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1.3,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,2,3,0,0,2,4.5,16760,1,-1,0,0,0,0

I never had Vietnamese before going here so I can't really compare it to anything. All I can say is what I've had there has all been very good. I especially love the spring rolls. The prices are very reasonable. I've been there a few times now and always see the same people working there so I'm guessing it's a owned by a small family. I'm all about supporting small business!

The only not-so-great thing I've run into there is that they have a couple of duck dishes on their menu but every time we've been there, they don't have duck. Which is a little odd to me because LeeLee sells whole duck (at a reasonable price too!). I don't understand why they have it on the menu if they're not actually going to have it available. 

But that small confusion aside, I've found it a decent place to grab a bite to eat that isn't deep-fat-fried and swimming in sugar. For the sugar, I suggest you go to the teashop right next door (also in LeeLee) and grab one of their fruit smoothie boba teas.

Of course, my friends and I used trusty yelp to find a restaurant and this was one of the first results.

Overall, the exterior is unlabeled and a bit difficult to see from the street. It's in an unassuming strip mall and took a few tries to find. However, the decor makes it stand out a bit.

When we entered, the waitress said we could sit wherever we liked and she came out with menus and took our drink order. I ordered a cinnamon iced tea, which I really liked. 

For our main order, my friend and I split a veggie combo plate for $11.99. This includes all of the veggie options on a thin injera disc and three pieces of injera bread on the side. 

For those of you who have never had injera bread, it's a doughy pancake-y type of bread with a strong sour taste, similar to sourdough bread. I personally enjoyed the injera but one of my friends has a distaste for sourdough bread so it kind of ruined the meal for her. She, however, did like her cabbage that she ordered. I liked all of the vegetarian options and I was glad that I got to sample them all. All of the options were delicious and surprisingly, very filling! My friend and I were able to eat maybe half of the plate together.

Overall, our waitress was very courteous and attentive, despite being the only one working there that day. There is also a small dance floor and various Ethiopian music videos playing on the projector at the back of the restaurant.

Someone more knowledgable than me is probably going to read this review and laugh at my attempts at describing this food, but having never tried anything like it before, I can't exactly find the words to describe what I ate.

My girlfriend and I went on a double date and told me that we were going to eat at Basil. The biggest gripe that I have about uptown is parking. I REFUSE to pay for parking if I don't have to, so I found a spot on 6th street and I was good to go. I believe they do offer valet parking for 5 bucks.

We arrived at the restaurant before the people we were supposed to be meeting, so that gave me a little time to check the place out. The restaurant is well put together. It had a modern feel to it with the lights dimmed to create a nice romantic and intimate feel. They finally came, so we get seated. I'm not sure what to order, so I took suggestions. For the appetizer, I tried the Fresh Basil Rolls, which I did NOT enjoy. It tasted like I was eating a slimy eraser or something. The waitress was semi-annoying as well. We all just had water, so she brought a really nice glass jug (which i thought about hijacking, haha) and placed it in the middle of the table. We didn't even touch the full jug b/c she kept on filling out water with another jug. I'd like to believe that i'm fully capable of pouring my own water, but maybe that's just me. I guess the jug was there for decoration or something , haha.

For the meal, I tried the Pad-See-Eu with Chicken. It was actually a very good dish. It just wasn't enough for me. When they brought our food to the table (which took about 30 minutes), I told my girlfriend that we'll probably have to make a stop to McDonalds or something b/c this wasn't going to be enough food for me, haha.

After two years of ethnographic observation, I think I cracked the Indian Buffet Code. In general the buffet consists of something like this:

Carbs:
- Pyaz Pakora: crispy deep fried onions. Yummy
- White rice with peas
- Fried vegetable rice
- Butter Naan and Garlic Naan

Then about 3 or 4 vegetable curries, such as
- Something beany: Channa masala, Dal
- Something greeny: Saag Paneer, Aloo Gobi Palak
- Something creamy: Paneer Tikki Masala, Shai Paneer
- Spiced Cabbage(y): I can never eat enough this

And then about three Chicken dishes (with a Lamb mixed in there sometimes too):
- Tandoori chicken
- Chicken Tikki Masala
- Chicken Saag
- Butter Chicken Masala

Dessert- about 1 or 2 of the following:
- Rice Kheer 
- Gulab Jamun
- Sliced fruit (oranges, watermelon)

If you're looking for a great thai cuisine experience, you have to go to Pete's.","review","nU97FczCPxm_wIp2pgtYfw","Thai",15,3.06666666666667,0,1,0,0,"AZ",5,2,4,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0.7,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,2,3.5,0,0,1.64414414414414,3.5213447171825,15611,0.0666666666666667,0,0,0,0,0

Absolutely delicious. The atmosphere was very cool and hipster-y. A great place to catch up with friends. The service was also excellent. I would definitely go back just for that amazing fried rice!!! This would also be a great place for a date.","review","ZHDf8TUICsB2peQ9AmXeFw","Thai",9,4.44444444444444,0,0,0,0,"NV",3.5213447171825,2,4,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1.3,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.64414414414414,3.5213447171825,16022,0.111111111111111,1.4786552828175,1,0,0,0

As soon as we walked in I could smell the aromas and fell in love immediately!  I have never had Indian food that was so good!  The hubby DREADS Indian but decided to spoil me.  He was definitely surprised.  This is the only Indian restaurant/food he has EVER liked!

Bad first impression:  The waitress was a little off.  There were 5 of us.  She looked around and told us that we had to wait for a table to open.  (Hmn, but there were 6 open tables...)  Another guy came by after a few minutes, pushed two tables together and seated us.  YAY!  .....10-15 minutes go by...no menus, no water, no waitress or waiter...a couple of more minutes and the waitress brings us some pakora and water......................no menus.  WTH?!  (I really wanted  to try this food...otherwise we would've be out after 10 minutes of waiting.)  So, we flag her down and request menus.  It was smooth sailing after that.  And boy was it worth the hassle.

If I could afford to go a few times a week I would.  I was craving this as soon as I woke up and again tonight.  A la carte meals are $15 on average and they're not big.  =(  Not a good match for a food lover on a budget.","review","QwrWxzfGdv_bMiFrDaV4sA","Indian",22,3.81818181818182,0,5,0,0,"NV",4,2,4,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1.3,1,1,10,1,1,1,0,0,1.6,4.1,0,0,1.64414414414414,3.5213447171825,15290,0.454545454545455,1,1,2,4,5

Not the case with Ruchi!  An entire buffet of vegetarian food!  It was like a dream.  I tried almost everything...and everything was really good!  The young guy that served us, was so nice and helpful, and after telling him it was my first time eating Indian food, he explained what things were, what chutneys go with what, and how things are generally eaten.
