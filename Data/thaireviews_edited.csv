As I knew nothing about Thai, she ordered a Thai Iced Tea for me, and it was creamy and delicious. Kinda like a Yoo-Hoo and iced tea, minus the chocolate. I ordered a second one, even though it was extra. I didn't care. 


We ordered the special appetizer, Soft Shell Crab. So worth the splurge. It was perfectly cleaned, unlike what I've had from Wholey's before. There were two sauces accompanying the crab, and both suited it's crispness perfectly. 

Jess made a few suggestions on what to get for the entree, (our waitress was in training, but still was awesome) and I decided on the Param, because I love peanut sauce! You could customize how hot you wanted your dish, but I was being a sissy that night, and decided to go with a 3. It was perfect. Jess got Yellow Curry Shrimp. I ate half of hers, too.  Oops. I've also never had curry before. Oh my. So good. 

We sat and chatted for a while, and were kept care of well with refills on our water. They are a BYOB,  so next time, I'll bring some beer! 
  

Happy Eating!",review,sxeuOMBRllOHXJTaUlI9kQ

The lunch specials are just hands down hard to beat. With soup, spring roll in duck sauce and an entree, I've tried the red curry with chicken and the pad thai with chicken and both made me go ""ohhhh, yum!"".

Having never had Thai before this, I am not sure how much I can really speak to the spices, authenticity, or things like that but here's the rundown:

1. Place is AUTHENTIC looking, with all the ornate wood carving it's just a cool place!
2. Waiters are very helpful and attentive
3. The tea they have is minty - yummy and refreshing
4. Every meal I had I've loved - it just takes great!

It may have been that I was starving and was depleted of all my energy, but the food here was great!!

The folks I was with swore up and down this place had some of the best Thai food in the Valley, so I let them do most of the ordering (I wanted to go the safe route via sweet and sour chicken, but they objected wholeheartedly).   

We ordered a variety of items, (appetizers, soups, and main dishes) and shared between the 3 of us.  It did take a little while (even with us and only one other party seated), but I was told this is because all items are cooked fresh when you order.  The lady serving us was very friendly, even when my friend was giving me crap about ordering medium spicy and not hot .  

It was all very good (If I attempted to spell some of the dishes I'd end up offending someone), I kept eating long after my stomach said ""no more"", since my taste buds were saying ""keep going!!""

My GF had the Thai BBQ chicken plate which was surprisingly good as well. They give out a bowl of soup as an appetizer which was so good also. I give this place a solid 5stars because for being my first time eating thai food it didnt disappoint in the taste and portion size. The service was great.

Be careful if you aren't used to spicy foods though as what you may called mild and order mild could possibly be too spicy for you which is what I saw happen to a friend. The waitress was nice enough to get him a drink for free to help get rid of the spiciness.

If you plan on going make a reservation 2-3 days before to be safe. We had a group of 15 people and tried to make a reservation the day of which was a bad idea, but luckily we put our name down and gave them our phone number and they called us after about an hour to tell us our table was ready.

Nice flavor but barely any chicken. The sweet and sour chicken was good but barely any chicken there as well. What we did have was a nice balance and it was nice that the chicken wasn't fried. The curry varied depending on who you asked and the drunken noodles were good just had to use fork and knife to cut a piece as one big cluster.

I am a very pedestrian eater when it comes to ethnic food. I don't like spicy, I don't like weird things.  So I was dreading my visit.  I was expecting to like 1 or 2 of the 10 things we ordered, in reality, there were only 2 of the 10 things I did NOT like (the spicy things)!

Since I do not have a baseline, I will just say everything was great, so from a picky ethnic eater, here was what stood out:

Mee Krob - interesting.  Just thought South Park made this word up.
Sea bass with Drunken Noodle - waiter recommendation over another sea bass pairing.
Crispy Duck with Panang - another waiter audible. Was spicy, but a great taste.
Pad Thai - again, interesting my unrefined palette
Mango Sweet Rice combined with Coconut Ice Cream - never had mango before, this was a treat! Definitely a great closer. Mango is only served in season. Wait for it.

Finally, the Thai Iced Tea was really cool.  Warning, do not let this water down in the ice, it will destroy the epic flavor.

Thai food has always been on my list but I never was intrigued enough to go out and try it until now. I'm glad I did because its absolutely delicious! We went during lunchtime on a weekday afternoon and the place was packed! After eating, I can see why. The portions are huge and cheap. What more can you ask for?

We were given an ordinary salad (ice burg, carrots, and tomatoes)  with a very sweet tasting vinaigrette. Didn't really enjoy it because it was too sweet for my liking but it was free so I shouldn't be complaining [: It took us a long time to order because I am a very indecisive person and everything sounded so good. They had Chinese type dish on their menu which I try not to want because I want to try Thai. 

We end up ordering a peanut curry with chicken and pad thai with tofu. The peanut curry came with rice and the pad thai came with a mix of lettuce and cabbage. Both came with a vegetable eggroll. We asked for medium spicy which was a little bit too spicy for me because I can't tolerate it too much but medium was enough spicy for my friend. Next time, I would definitely go mild. 

How it work is you pick your dish then they ask you to pick your protein. I think its between beef, seafood, chicken, tofu, or vegetable. Then you pick your spice level. 

Oh and we ended up ordering mango sticky rice for dessert. Sweet sticky rice topped with coconut milk and a side of mango. It was delicious! My friend said it tasted like the one he had in Thailand and when we spoke to the owner, he said he makes the sweet sticky rice fresh everyday [: (I liked the black sweet rice more and my friend likes the white one but whichever one you order should be fine cause they are delicious!)

Overall we enjoy the food very much. I can't wait to try other Thai dishes from here. Only downfall is I live so far away but I found out the owner lives near me out in East Mesa. Poor guy. Commuting must be a pain. I would definitely recommend this place. Now I think I'm brave enough to try other Thai places.

My girlfriend and I went on a double date and told me that we were going to eat at Basil. The biggest gripe that I have about uptown is parking. I REFUSE to pay for parking if I don't have to, so I found a spot on 6th street and I was good to go. I believe they do offer valet parking for 5 bucks.

We arrived at the restaurant before the people we were supposed to be meeting, so that gave me a little time to check the place out. The restaurant is well put together. It had a modern feel to it with the lights dimmed to create a nice romantic and intimate feel. They finally came, so we get seated. I'm not sure what to order, so I took suggestions. For the appetizer, I tried the Fresh Basil Rolls, which I did NOT enjoy. It tasted like I was eating a slimy eraser or something. The waitress was semi-annoying as well. We all just had water, so she brought a really nice glass jug (which i thought about hijacking, haha) and placed it in the middle of the table. We didn't even touch the full jug b/c she kept on filling out water with another jug. I'd like to believe that i'm fully capable of pouring my own water, but maybe that's just me. I guess the jug was there for decoration or something , haha.

For the meal, I tried the Pad-See-Eu with Chicken. It was actually a very good dish. It just wasn't enough for me. When they brought our food to the table (which took about 30 minutes), I told my girlfriend that we'll probably have to make a stop to McDonalds or something b/c this wasn't going to be enough food for me, haha.

I ordered the ""best thai noodles"" and had them deliver it to my house. It took over an hour, and after being 30 minutes over an hour the lady who delivered my food yelled at me for not telling her the access key to our apartment complex. What!? Excuse me!?

Anyway, moving on. I was excited to dig in! But I have never tasted anything that tasted exactly like vomit. I am so sorry - I know that is gross, but it was literally that awful. The noodles were greasy, the flavor was awful, my noodles were cold. Now I'm not a conesuer of thai food so I may not be the best one to ask about the taste of thai however the customer service was less than acceptable. 

I will not be ordering from Naga again.",review,wgP52y-7FkrsZVVHGomoog

I loved it.  The people were super nice and one of them was telling us a hilarious story about his recent birthday antics in vegas.  He made us feel completely comfortable.  The portion sizes were humongous, so it's probably a good idea to split something.  I got the Chow-mein thai style noodles with beef.  Amazing!!!  They ask you how spicy you want it on a scale of 1-5 (""1"" being not spicy and ""5"" being OMG spicy).I recommend not going any higher than ""3"" on the spice and I'm a huge lover of spicy food.  

If you're looking for a great thai cuisine experience, you have to go to Pete's.",review,nU97FczCPxm_wIp2pgtYfw

I had never had Thai before this year - the man and I have tried a few places around LV to compare, and nothing compares to Le Thai.  My aunt, who loves Thai food, swears it's some of the best she's ever had (and she's not from around here!)

The food, the ambiance, the PBR in cans...it's all wonderful.  We've had some amazing service (huge shout-out to the server who convinced me to switch from Pad Thai to the Awesome noodles - BEST SUGGESTION EVER), and we've had some ok service, but the food is always consistent.  I don't get mine very spicy (I'm a ""1"" on the scale of 1-5), but apparently anything 2+ can range from decently spicy to ""melt your face off"" (I think that my boyfriend accidentally got a 3.5 one time instead of a 2...it was pretty rough!)

Go here.  Just not on the same days I go, please, as I don't like waiting for a table!  :)",review,ZHDf8TUICsB2peQ9AmXeFw

Absolutely delicious. The atmosphere was very cool and hipster-y. A great place to catch up with friends. The service was also excellent. I would definitely go back just for that amazing fried rice!!! This would also be a great place for a date.",review,ZHDf8TUICsB2peQ9AmXeFw

 Not only did they offer Thai, but they also offered Chinese and Japanese. I will say, the Japanese options are very limited. The wait time of the restaurant was awesome! Once we decided what to order, the food was at the table in 5 minutes max. It tasted like authentic Asian cuisine, and was incredibly flavorful and delicious! We ate family style but I'm not sure if they offer individual platters. Our server was incredibly polite and informative. I enjoyed the experience. I might move to Vegas just to eat here!",review,s4Ki8L-zutVJexVSnFlP-Q

I've been here for lunch 4 times now in the past month or so.  I always get the pad siew with beef and it's delicious!  You can choose your spice level (mild, medium, hot) and medium is just spicy enough to make my nose run.  You can also choose chicken, beef, or tofu for your dish (my vegetarian coworker loves this place too).  I can't say anything about the curry dishes because I'm not a fan of curry but my coworkers say it's great.",review,Yv_tRinWxlTvJ9Op3NmAUg
