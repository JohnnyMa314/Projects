I took my grandma out on a date and we decided to try Hachi. I'm very glad we did. We were seated within minutes and our waiter helped us promptly, I want to say his name was Paul. We ordered the Pink Hibiscus Sake (it was sweet but I don't think I'd order it again), chicken pot stickers, crab & mango salad, a beef dish, chicken fried rice, & hot sake. Everything tasted great, my favorite being the chicken pot stickers and chicken fried rice. I have never had Japanese food that was light, not greasy, flavorful, and filling before Hachi. Our service was perfect. I really dislike being asked how I'm doing or if everything is okay every 5 minutes. Our server took our order, made sure it came promptly, gave me eye contact while making his rounds, asked me once or twice if I'd like to try anything else, made some suggestions, wam bam, thank you ma'am. I will definitely be returning to try more of the menu. Oh, and the decor is stunning. Next time you sit down in the main room, just look up :).",review,iLwNx5TVKVFKyV5RdbIY-A

This is the first and only Japanese pastry place. If you're a fan of Kabuto or Goyemons treats, these are the pastry chefs that created those items. For those who have never had Japanese desserts the best way to describe them is decadent, yet delicate. It's not about saccharine, sugary highs, but all about balance. Often they play on flavors that are a bit sweet, a bit savory (think green tea, red bean, sesame, etc). 

I picked up some stuff to-go : 

Green tea cream puff - solid cream puff. I sliced it in half and half of the cream is vanilla cream and half was nice, strong matcha flavored whip. We make some awesome cream puffs at home and I feel these are just as good. 

Brandied cherry black forest - I enjoyed the chocolate mousse in this and appreciated that the cherries were brandied and not the usual neon ice cream cherries. 

Yuzu panna cotta - This was bright citrusy pungent flavor that I love about yuzu and the texture was on point of a panna cotta. I get rather disappointed how unbalanced many places are between creamy and gelatine. 

Tofu cheesecake - light and fluffy. I'm a big fan of Japanese style cheesecake since it's almost like a whipped mousse instead of being dense. It's one of those things that you can eat a lot of since it's not overbearing.

For the quality, the prices aren't out of line, but this isn't your cheapest bakery either. The quality though and presentation is top notch and something you would expect to see at a on strip patisserie charging for more. If you were going to a dinner party or gifting pastries, this would be one of the places to consider for being beautiful, and having unique offerings. 

I will be back for crepes. It's been a long while since I've had a proper crepe. Will be making sure to stop in again when I'm on this side of town.",review,DqJij-nTV3yvmJqfd8KAOQ

I had never had Japanese curry so I didn't really know what to expect although I had seen some photos and honestly the dishes did not seem to aesthetically pleasing. But I had heard great things and my friend was always raving how good it is so I went with an open mind.

I went with the chicken cutlet and the croquette. The taste was ok, but it definitely could've used some vegetables. Yes, they have corn, but something green would've been nice. It would've lent the dish some freshness too, I think. What with the rice, the croquette, the breaded chicken and the brown sauce, it just seemed kind of monotonous to me.

I have to say, if one were to compare them to Thai, Indian, or other curries I've had in the past, Japanese curry seemed more bland and thick, almost like a gravy.

They had plenty of seasoning shakers on the table though, so a few sprinkles of extra hot woke up the dish, and it was very enjoyable!

We tried a little bit of everything here, with Cathy ordering the Pork cutlet, Chicken Cutlet, Kurobuta Sausage and Croquette for us to try. It was cooked well, with lots of juicy meat and great flavor in the breading.

I've never eaten Japanese curry before, so I decided to try it for the first time at this highly-rated establishment. The photos of white rice and brown curry on plain white plates did not stimulate my appetite (slightly unappetizing looking), however, those 150 Yelpers before me could not all be wrong. For our late lunch, we shared a regular-size order of rice and curry (spice level 0) with the 5 piece Kushi Curry option. I'm not sure of the ""right"" way to eat curry, so I mixed together the rice and curry slurry and dug in. Mmm. Wow, it's really very yummy, a fantastic combination of spices. The skewers of fried goodies were all pretty good too. I really liked the potato croquette. It was something like mashed potatoes rolled in an egg mixture and coated with panko, then lovingly lowered it into the deep fryer. The panko-coated fried quail eggs were slightly rubbery and had a green-grey tinge around the yolk, but no biggie. Most people boil the heck out of eggs. 

Yelp did me right. Thank you! 
*Low prices 
*Filling, low-brow tasty Asian fare
*Nice service
*Tiny hole in the wall with a few bar stools and (three?) small tables, so try to come at off-peak meal times. The tables seat four, so when a group of six came in, they stood in the middle of the restaurant and watched the two parties of two eat their food. Awkward! I wouldn't mind some breathing room to scarf down my lunch... :P",review,BVCDPqlHMDPLWn9EhdDXNg

This was as ""comforty"" as any comfort food I can get back home in the land of the Norwegians and Germans.  Spicier, but still great comfort food.  I'd stack this up against cheese buttons or klub any day!  You probably don't know what cheese buttons or klub even is.  Trust me...anything that stacks up to cheese buttons and klub is pretty freaking good.

The waitress and cook talked me down from a spice level 5 to a spice level 3.  I think they were concerned for my safety or something.  :)  Wish I would've stuck to my guns, oh well.

I wanted to try something new and I was in Chinatown area. I've never had Japanese style fried chicken with curry sauce. It looked interesting, so I decided to stop by.

I started out by ordering Ashi ($2.95/small glass). I ordered Toko-yaki (~$4) and fried shu-mai ($3.75). Toko-yaki was batter was good, but the octopus was bit too chewy. Fried shu-mai are really small, but they have good flavor and frying anything makes it great. 

My main course meal was the chicken katsu with level 10 spicy curry. This might be the first restaurant to charge money to make things spicy (like I won't be paying a price next morning). When I the plate the curry sauce looked red hot (not sure if you can see it in the pic), but upon eating it I was bit disappointed with the spice level. However, I became a fan of this meal. I think this is the best way to eat a fried chicken. The chicken was tender and the batter was just the right amount. Rice and curry also complimented very well with juicy chicken. The price is also perfect $9 for the whole meal. 

I will definitely be back for more. The only negatives I can say is that the TVs are tiny, and I wish the bathrooms didn't smell like someone had a curry explosion. The service is good and the servers take their time to explain the menu item if you are new. 

Check out this place, it really is a gem, but stay away from their bathroom and bring a pair of binoculars if you want to watch a football game on their TV.",review,BVCDPqlHMDPLWn9EhdDXNg

The place is kinda small and the ""waiting list"" is just a sheet of paper you have to write your own name on and they'll call you when there's a table ready.  
It's just west of Decatur on Spring Mountain. It's in the same shopping center as Monta Ramen, Kung Fu Tea, and Raku. 

I'd never had japanese curry before.  I got the chicken katsu+curry spicy level 2+corn+cheese. I left a $4 tip and the total was $15.52.  I can see why this is crave-worthy.  The only thing I can compare it to is curry-wurst in Germany.  It's like a thick brown gravy with curry in it.  The chicken was fried perfectly in a panko coating but was incredibly bland.  Maybe it's supposed to be like that to balance the strong curry.  The rice was wonderfully sticky and the cheese made the whole dish feel comforting.  

Level 2 spicy was just enough...my white girl palette can only handle so much.  It would be really good with french fries I bet.  I liked it and I'd eat it again.",review,BVCDPqlHMDPLWn9EhdDXNg

My first time at Zen....this place is tiny!  I don't think I have ever seen, let alone ate at a restaurant any smaller lol...makes some of these local Ramen-Ya look huge :P

The food was pretty good though!  We ordered the Pork, Chicken, Sausage, and Potato cake and all were juicy and flavorful.  It was my first time eating Japanese curry, and I have to say, it was a little bland for my taste buds...in comparison to the Thai, Indian, and other Asian curries I am more accustomed to.

Of course we were all here to say goodbye to Tetsuro's Yelp presence, and there was plenty of good conversation to be had...I feel bad, since we didn't leave until after 130am, and I know they close at 11pm!

I want everyone to succeed and prosper.  I had never eaten curry before and did not know what to expect.  The place was clean, spacious and the person that took my order was friendly.  The large picture of dishes on the wall were about as unappetizing as I had ever seen.  The only colors were brown sauce with white rice with a few ""lumps"" under the sauce.  No Color whatsoever, but I thought it might  be an advertising mistake that the owner just had to deal with.

Walking into this restaurant, I really liked how they decorated this place. The dark woods, and mellow atmosphere really gave it a sexy vibe. I was digging it.

Gyu-Kaku might have the best grills I have ever seen. What makes them so great are the little vents that surrounds the grill. This makes the smoke disappear quickly, rather than engulf your clothes in meat smoke, which tends to happen at k-bbqs.

The first thing I ordered were the cheese wontons. Out of everything that I had ordered, this proved to be my least favorite. When I was thinking of a cheese wonton, I expected there to be a full pocket of cheese. That was not to be the case. Instead, there was the tiniest sliver of cheese that could be known to mankind. I should have taken a picture of that.

Then my meats came. I thought they were alright. I thought it was good, but I guess I was expecting more. Even though I came in during happy hour, I ordered like three dishes and spent quite a bit on them. Afterwards, I had to go buy a cheeseburger at a take out joint nearby because I was still pretty hungry.

The service here was not very good. The guy taking our order was very nice and accommodating, but he seemed lost at times. I constantly had to flag him down. And, he did mess up our order at the end of the night, charging us for extra things that we didn't order, but we were quickly able to fix the situation.

I don't know if I'll be back here. My experience was so-so. Maybe I'll come back here later in the future if they improve their service. But I thought the food was aight except for the cheese wontons, which were a ripoff. That's my story, and I'm sticking to it.",review,5mMk3Ted-EOyHvJ-j9BhiQ
