But Pho Real seemed like a safe bet for tasting Vietnamese food based on the recommendations of co-workers.  I've been twice in the past 3 weeks and I'm equally impressed with the service and food.

On both occasions, I ordered the delicious lemongrass chicken.  It's a sweet and spicy dish with grilled chicken, onions (and lots of 'em), zucchini, carrots, and cauliflower.  This heaping dish is served with clumpy white rice.  The flavor is out of this world!  On the first trip, I ordered a Jasmine tea and on my last trip, a mango-flavored bubble tea.  The bubble tea is more like a smoothie/slushie with tapioca balls at the bottom...yum yum!  I felt like a kid again.  

On both trips, I was promptly seated.  The server was proactive in asking if I had any questions about the dishes and regularly checked on me.  My parents, who had not eaten Vietnamese food previously, joined me for the second visit.  I explained to Hannah, the owner, and she was very gracious in explaining the menu options.  After they decided on pho, she brought out the ""fixings"" (lime, mint leaves, bean sprouts) and suggested how they should enjoy an authentic pho.  No condescension or impatience on Hannah's part, I'm really impressed by that.  

The interior is pretty awesome...green walls and velvet seats. Definitely, a night lounge vibe but none of the pretension.  If you've never eaten Vietnamese food, Pho Real is a nice on-ramp to fulfilling meal...for real. (Ha ha, real pun-ny!!!)",review,x98vOAFB3nBZEirsHwVY3g

Hubby ordered the Vegetarian Pho and it was fantastic! Beautiful-looking and tasty, the broth was very flavourful, and tons of crunchy veggies with rice noodles that were not overcooked like they can normally be. I ordered the Vermicelli with Tofu. Once again, the tofu was cooked perfectly and had very good flavour! The vermicelli were very well cooked too and I loved the Thai basil in this dish especially.

I was looking up restaurants that had received good reviews in the area & found this one to try. I've never had Vietnamese food so I was really excited. We walked in and were promptly seated. It was really busy which we took as a really good sign. There were some big groups that had come in but the service was still on par - the waitress took our order & it wasn't very long before we got it.

I had ordered the Lat Na & my lunch companion ordered the House Pho'nomenal. The Lat Na was just some chicken, shrimp, & noodles in a sweet sauce ... Nothing flavorful. And I had ordered it at a 2 on a 1-5 scale & it came out pretty spicy. The chicken had a weird taste / smell & the shrimp wasn't much better ... It had the texture of frozen shrimp that had been overcooked. I tried a bite of the Pho & couldn't have much more than that but my companion enjoyed it.

The awful part was that the table was really sticky and there were soup spoons in a holder which I had to pick through 3 of them to find a clean one to use. Also, there were some patrons at a table just next to us who asked to move b/c there were ants all over their table. When we got to the front to pay our bill, we also saw some ants on the counter & there were 2 people who worked there standing right by them who made no effort to clean it up! Additionally, our to-go box was leaking ... Perhaps the ants had bitten through it.

unPHOgettable is tucked into an Asian cultural center just south of Main Street on Dobson on the west side of the road and is part of the Asian grocery story, but has it's own entrance and eating area. It had a pretty nice atmosphere, the owner was very helpful and even recognized my friend and his wife as we walked in (I figured they either eat there quite a bit, or the owner remembers him because he doesn't likely see very many tall, geeky, white kids who speak Vietnamese). The menu had a very wide selection and did a decent job of explaining what each of the items are. The owner offered to go over the menu with us, since it was our first time, but my friend told him that he would handle it. The place was pretty clean and the staff was very helpful. My only minor complaint was that there was a minor fish odor in the air, but I wasn't quite sure if it was the restaurant's fish or the adjoining Asian grocery store that had the fishy smell. Either way it wasn't overpowering and didn't detract from our meal at all.

I ordered Pho with thin sliced beef and tendon. I have to admit, that when I looked at the menu, I thought tendon was tenderloin, so I assumed I was ordering thin strips of beef with beef junks. It wasn't until my friend's wife repeated my order with an emphasis on TENDON that I realized what I ordered. Either way though, I'm pretty adventurous so I figured I'd give it a shot. My wife ordered a flat noodle meal instead of the soup since she's had it before. The food didn't take long and we were brought our enormous bowls of Pho with all the trimmings. I added a decent amount of hoisen sauce, and an even more decent amount of hot sauce. The broth in my bowl actually ended up pretty dark red. I added in my bean sprouts, tore up my basil and plopped in my jalapeños to boot. I dug in and was amazed at how great it tasted. I wasn't really amazed that it tasted good, but that it tasted SO good AND I'd never had it before. Why had people kept this a secret from me? It was fantastic and right up my alley. Soup, hot sauce and noodles. I wolfed mine down and even tried my wife's noodle dish, not really enough to give a thorough review, but it was good, and I'd try it again.

The prices weren't bad, I ended up paying about $22 for the two of us to eat our meals and a small appetizer split between 4 people. Range: $7.50 - $12.00.

Sorry for posting without pictures, but I'm sure I'll be back and append some pics to this after my next bowl.

Because of this place, I am now a fan of Vietnamese food, specifically the Pho soup.

We ordered the quail to start and it was delicious. The spices on it were just right and the skin was crisp and had a sweet caramelized bbq flavor. Of course since it was quail the portion was tiny, but the flavor and moistness were perfect. 

When I got my pho I struggled to eat it with chopsticks. An art I still haven't mastered. Forks were not provided and I didn't want to be rude and ask for one so I just dealt. 

The broth was okay. It seemed sort of bland, even after I added quite a bit of torn fresh basil leaves and a squirt of lime. I also added sprouts, but that was all that came standard with this dish. I was hoping for a wider variety of veggies to add, there weren't any onions or chili peppers which I think would have helped. About halfway through the dish I ended up adding some hoisin sauce to give it more depth, but it only helped marginally. The portion size was good, though the amount of beef in the bowl was lacking. It had probably about 6 pieces the size of a quarter each. 

My fiancé ordered #29 com suon-bi-cha which was a grilled pork chip, ""shredded"" (more like small chunks) pork cook in a glaze, rice and a fried egg (even though it says quiche on the menu it was just an egg over medium). I tasted both preparations of pork and really enjoyed it. In fact I was a little disappointed that I hadn't ordered what he had because it was much more flavorful than my soup. 

I would be willing to go back and try another dish and see if the flavor was improved. The environment was nice, the service was prompt and friendly, and the food was average. I might add on more vegetables next time, maybe onions and mushroom if they have it, and maybe try a pho with a different beef preparation. 

Also, Pittsburgh legend Rick Sebak came in for dinner while we were there and that made me happy.",review,2EEmhVhG5SCt8dEo5zf-Hg

I consider myself pretty adventurous when it comes to food and I'll try just about anything once, so it surprised me when I realized that I had never had Vietnamese cuisine before.
 
Upon reviewing the menu, I was very thankful that they include descriptions of the dishes under each entrée. I settled on the Bun Cha Thit Nuong  which was described as having charbroiled pork with bean sprouts, lettuce, herb, cucumber & peanuts on vermicelli with a crispy spring roll.  Grilled Pork and veggies; how could you go wrong?  About five minutes later I had my ""Bun Cha"" in front of me.  Here's where I discovered my ignorance.... I swirled my chop stick around the noodles ensuring to include a nice piece of pork  and when I tasted it I found, to my surprise, that it was cold.  Very tasty mind you but cold.  I'm at least proud of the fact that instead of immediately calling the nice lady who waited on me over, I had the good sense to Google what it was that I was eating.
 
It turns out that Wikipedia described my dish exactly how it was served to me: ""Bún tht nng (literally means ""rice noodles [with] grilled meat"") is a popular Vietnamese cold rice vermicelli noodle dish topped with grilled pork, fresh herbs like basil and mint, fresh salad and bean sprouts, and ch giò (spring rolls)."" Yes, the good folks at Vietnam's Pho do indeed serve up authentic dishes. Although it wasn't what I expected at first, I did find the meal very enjoyable and I look forward to coming back and trying other Vietnamese cuisine here.",review,2EEmhVhG5SCt8dEo5zf-Hg

This visit was a visit of firsts. My first time at this restaurant and my first time eating Vietnamese food. Both were spectacular! This restaurant isn't much to look at on the outside, but it's got everything it needs on the inside including friendly staff, cheap prices and delicious dishes. 

I will admit that the menu is completely overwhelming for a newbie like me. I had no idea what I wanted, but luckily I was dining with pros so they guided me in the right direction. I started with the spring rolls and opted for a pork bun. The spring rolls were really refreshing and I enjoyed the peanut sauce to accompany it. I wasn't a huge fan of the basil and/or cilantro that came inside, so next time I would ask for them to leave the herbs out. The bun was delicious and huge! I snuck some of my remaining peanut sauce in there and poured in the sauce that came with it. I had no idea that it was fish sauce but I'm glad I didn't because I gave it a chance and really liked it! The bun had pork, noodles and eggs rolls. I only ate about half of it and was completely stuffed but not in a bad way. It was the perfect amount of food with the right spices and heartiness. As I enjoyed my meal and company, I looked around and noticed how crowded this place gets with every walk of life!

Guess how much my bill was for spring rolls, bun and a diet coke? Around $8-$10. I'm serious! For the price alone, I will return, but for the food and friendly service, I will return sooner.",review,yVQiGdxmnrkJDyQXv2maNA

We were tired and hungry and sitting in the hallway to the parking lot of Paris.  We turned around and saw a poster for SEA directly above our heads.  Something in my mind clicked and I realized that this was the sister restaurant for SEA in New York which was featured in Sex & the City but also, more importantly, for one of my favorite scenes in one of my favorite movies of all time: Garden State.  ""umm...we're a Vietnamese restaurant?  We don't serve bread?""  ""Can I get something to chew on?  F***, bamboo.  Whatever.""

So it was decided that we would go to SEA for our final meal that weekend in Vegas.

I'd never had Vietnamese food before, so I stuck to my old standby, shrimp red curry and sticky rice, from the Thai said of the restaurant.  The shrimp was well cooked and the curry flavorful.  BF went for a Vietnamese noodle dish with steak.  Mine was very very good, however, the Vietnamese dish was outstanding.  I totally wished I'd gotten the same thing.  The noodles were delicate and the steak supremely flavorful and tender.

The atmosphere is great--I absolutely love sitting along the water, facing the statue.  I thought I would just explode quoting Garden State throughout dinner.  My one issue was that the lighting was dim and pleasant, but that there was no curtain separating the glaring kitchen lights from the rest of the eating area, some what taking away the dream light atmosphere.

Best of all, it didn't totally break the bank and was a truly delicious and memorable meal.  I love finding places like this along the strip!",review,_Q4VSHSr8ryAOfmsd9g6yA

Now for my review!   

PHO SERVED TIL 2AM?   25 BEERS ON TAP!!   AWESOME!!!!!!!!

I have been going to Pho Cao since it opened almost 2 years ago!  I have never had bad service there, unless it was busy.  Even then, Having worked in the service industry for years, I understand when there is a dinner rush or a busy event going on, a server can get a ton of requests all at once.  The fact is, most folks throughout these reviews are inexperienced diners and don't understand the  concept of (sometimes when the wait staff is taking care of quite a few people, you may not get your extra basil in the 30 second time frame you expect)!!!!

I have never had Vietnamese cuisine before so i was skeptical.  To my surprise,  I LOVE IT!  My favorite dishes are the Rare Beef Pho and the Shaken Beef Entree ( i don't eat fish)   They are always prompt with service and the food is always piping hot!  If I ever need more basil, I just ask for it, not complain on Yelp about getting too little. LOL!

The bartender has always been friendly to me.  Generous Pours and great specials too!

They have Karaoke Wed, Thurs, and Friday and there are lots of great singers!  The stage is great an the Plush Leather VIP sofas are a nice touch for comfort!  They have a great lighting and sound system that makes you feel like you are the lead singer in a band!   

If you aren't into Vietnamese cuisine,  they also have stuff like fries, wings and potstickers to munch on...  All quite good!!  Always hot and always fresh!

I would not only recommend Pho Cao for Lunch or Dinner, i would also say that the hospitality of their events like their blues jam and karaoke events is 2nd to none!  I am very defensive of this place because I know how passionate the owner is in making sure everyone is satisfied and happy!

I noticed someone writing a comment on the smell!  I know exactly what they are talking about!   Another Ignorant review!   In case nobody has noticed in the last year,  Tempe has been replacing sewer lines just north of loop 202 on scottsdale road, as well as along Gilbert Drive(pho cao's location)  Nobody wants to smell a funky odor when you are trying to dine, i understand that, but It isn't the restaurant's fault the air quality sucks.  Besides, Between the delicious smell of the kitchen, and the pleasant fragrances they burn, I've never had an uncomfortable dining experience there.   Any moron would recognize this is an air quality issue with only the city of Tempe to blame...  NOT the restaurant.   Once again, shows the intelligence of a Yelp Poster.  Shame on you!  :-P

Next time you have a issue here, just ask for the owner instead of crying on Yelp.  He has always been there when I have visited and always taken great care of me and my party!

I never had Vietnamese before going here so I can't really compare it to anything. All I can say is what I've had there has all been very good. I especially love the spring rolls. The prices are very reasonable. I've been there a few times now and always see the same people working there so I'm guessing it's a owned by a small family. I'm all about supporting small business!

The only not-so-great thing I've run into there is that they have a couple of duck dishes on their menu but every time we've been there, they don't have duck. Which is a little odd to me because LeeLee sells whole duck (at a reasonable price too!). I don't understand why they have it on the menu if they're not actually going to have it available. 

But that small confusion aside, I've found it a decent place to grab a bite to eat that isn't deep-fat-fried and swimming in sugar. For the sugar, I suggest you go to the teashop right next door (also in LeeLee) and grab one of their fruit smoothie boba teas. Yum!",review,3Wxp8wNfUuYUohTpNMLotQ

AZ Pho Grill is a Vietnamese restaurant located in southeast Chandler. It was in a small complex hidden in the back area of the plaza.  As we walked in, it was very quiet and not a lot of people eating. There was music playing that seemed to be of Vietnamese decent.  It was very light and relaxing. We were waited on by an energetic young lady who was friendly and helped answer questions that we had regarding this type of food. Looking at the menu was definitely an eye opener because my family and I have never eaten Vietnamese food before. After about twenty minutes and many questions asked, we all decided what we would like to try and eat. 

     My dad ordered an appetizer for all of us to share. It was called AZ Pho and Grill's Sampler. It came with egg rolls, spring rolls, and coconut shrimp (two of each) served with sweet and sour sauce, fish sauce, and peanut sauce. The egg rolls seemed to taste similar to Chinese egg rolls while the spring rolls were wrapped in a clear skin filled with what seemed to be fresh vegetables and shrimp.  The coconut shrimp were deep fried to perfections with just a slight taste of coconut. My favorite had to be the spring rolls dipped in sweet and sour sauce. Once we finished the appetizer, we all ordered something different. My mother ordered Grilled Chicken Rice Plate that had tomatoes cucumbers and carrots on the side. The chicken was thinly cut and grilled. My father ordered Quang-Nam Noodle, which came with yellow rice noodles marinated in yellow and green curry, pork, chicken, shrimp and quail eggs. There were two quail eggs so my dad and I both tried it. Biting into it, it was very squishy and tasted like a hard-boiled egg. My brother ordered chicken fried rice that contained large chunks of chicken accented with mint. A basic dish, yet very tasty and filling.  I ordered Grilled Shrimp, Chicken, and Egg Roll Vermicelli Bowl which contained rice noodles topped with fish sauce poured over the shrimp and chicken. The words ""fish sauce"" brought an immediate visualization of an oily sauce with fish parts in it.  It was a delicious light sweet (with a little tang) sauce that would taste wonderful on any dish. I tried a little bit of everyone's plate and I would have to say the Grilled Chicken Rice Plate had to be my favorite. 

     All in all, this cultural event was a very good experience and something I am glad I tried. It made me go out of my comfort zone and try foods that I wouldn't have tried on a normal basis. I am very glad I got to share a different culture's food with my family. It was a good experience. The workers were very knowledgeable and gave our family great customer service. As we got up to leave, the workers all waved us goodbye and said they hoped to see us soon.",review,g4lTsPZiSM4VqrhJiaNkRA
